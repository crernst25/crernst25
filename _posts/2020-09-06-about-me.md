# About Me 

Hey readers! I am Caroline Ernst (she/her), a senior English major at Christopher Newport University. Within my major, I am working on a writing concentration, and I have minors in literature and classical studies. On campus, I am also a consultant for the writing center, a tutor for Italian, and work as the lead tutor for all of the foreign language tutors. 
Whenever I announce that I am an English major, I always get a lot of looks of pity. Even when I told my mother that I was getting my degree in English, she chimed in with that all too familar refrain: *but there's no jobs in English!* 
When it comes to English majors, it seems there are three options: teaching, law, and publishing. Personally, I would love to go into editing, since I love working technically with the language and with formatting to bring a work together effectively for its intended audience.
