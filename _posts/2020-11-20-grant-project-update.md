# Grant Project Update: What I Have Been Doing Lately 

--- 

For my project, I am pitching a digital anthology of Sappho's poetry. Sappho was a poet from Ancient Greece who lived on the island of Lesbos, and is often referred to as the Ninth Muse for her lyrical poetry. Besides being one of the only surviving female poets from this time period, Sappho was also bisexual and Lesbos is the origin of the word for lesbian. Her existence as a bisexual female poet helps further LGBTQ+ history and lets our existence stand beyond the past century, showing that homosexuality is not a new thing, but a natural human phenomenon that has occurred for eons.
