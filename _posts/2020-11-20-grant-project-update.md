# Grant Project Update

## My Project

For my project, I am pitching a digital anthology of Sappho's poetry. Sappho was a poet from Ancient Greece who lived on the island of Lesbos, and is often referred to as the Ninth Muse for her lyrical poetry. Besides being one of the only surviving female poets from this time period, Sappho was also bisexual and Lesbos is the origin of the word for lesbian. Her existence as a bisexual female poet helps further LGBTQ+ history and lets our existence stand beyond the past century, showing that homosexuality is not a new thing, but a natural human phenomenon that has occurred for eons. 

Rather than just making a collection of her work, I would also like to incorporate several different translations of Sappho's poetry in my anthology so that readers can also think on the process of translation. I would like to allow for users to switch easily between the different English translations for each poem, so that they can compare and contrast each version. For Greek poetry, translation is essential, and each translator makes different choises to bring the poem to life during the translation process. 

## Research 

When researching the field to see what already exists, I found that there weren't a lot of collections of Sappho's work in general, and when I did find them, they weren't very interactive. 

Sean B. Palmer's webpage, [*Sappho's Poems*](http://inamidst.com/stuff/sappho/), contains both the original Greek and an English translation of the poem, but the translations aren't side-by-side, making it hard to compare the translations to the original. Further, all of the poems are on one page with an endless scroll, so it is difficult to find a specific poem if there is one that the reader has in mind. 

On the other hand, [*The Digital Sappho*](https://digitalsappho.org/fragments/fr118-168/) by Haverford Commentary Library offers a table of contents on the left hand side of their page, where visitors can scroll through and choose the poems that they would like to look at. However, this resource does not focus on the translation of the poem as a whole, but instead looks more at what the meaning of individual words within the poem mean. While this is helpful for breaking down the Ancient Greek, the poem loses the art that gained Sappho her title as the Ninth Muse. 

Later in my researching process, I came across [*The Homer Multitext Project*](http://www.homermultitext.org/), which focuses solely on the works of Homer, specifically the different translations of *The Iliad*. While this project doesn't relate to Sappho, it was the closest thing I found to what I want to do. Here is an anthology of Homer's works in one place, collecting different translations, and urging comparisons between the different versions. When opening a specific translation, this site also has the English and Greek side-by-side so that the lines of the poems are matched up. Further, when I drag my mouse over a line, it highlights the whole line in both translations in yellow, allowing the reader to focus on the line-by-line translation.

In a column on the left, there is the original Greek translations, while the English translation sits opposite to it on the right. One line is highlighted yellow, matching up the two translations.](http://crernst25.github.io/crernst25/images/the-homer-multitext-project.png)

The only criticism I have of this site is that each translation has its own separate page, instead of organizing all of the translations together on one page where the user can easily switch between the different translations. 

## Fragment 147 

In addition to researching several different sites so that I can further differentiate my project and improve on what already exists, I have also started collecting translations of my favorite Sappho poem: Fragment 147. Not only is this a poem that I think is particularly beautiful and thought-provoking, I also think that it helps to highlight how different translations can have very different interpretations of the same poem. 

The translation featured below is my personal favorite, taken from Anne Carson's collection, *If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho*: 

![Screenshot of Fragment 147 that reads: someone will remember us / I say / even in another time](http://crernst25.github.io/crernst25/images/carson-translation.png) 

In a similar translation to Carson, there is also Mary Bernard's: 

![Screenshot of Fragment 147 that reads: Let me tell you this: / someone in some future time / will think of us](http://crernst25.github.io/crernst25/images/mary-bernard-translation.png)

Next, a translation from Edwin Marion Cox, which has a very different meaning from the previous two, despite being from the same fragment: 

![Screenshot of Fragment 147 that reads: I think men will remember us even hereafter. The original Greek is also stated above the English translation.](http://crernst25.github.io/crernst25/images/cox-translation.png)

Lastly, I pull from *The Digital Sappho* to represent the original Greek, but also to utilize their vocab function from their cite to show where the other three translators are pulling their meanings from:

Overall, I am very excited to continue working with this project. I definitely still have a lot more work and research to do as I move towards my budget portion of the project, but I am glad I am working on something that I am passionate about and that motivates me to learn about writing grants!
