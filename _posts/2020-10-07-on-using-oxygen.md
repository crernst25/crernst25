# On Using Oxygen: My First Experience with Coding in XML 

---

For this assignment, I was given the second column of page 649 of Charlotte Perkins Stetson's short horror story, "The Yellow Wallpaper". With this section, I was tasked with coding the text as it appeared using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) in Oxygen, a coding program that uses eXtensible Markup Language (XML). As a part of our assignment, I mimicked markup in a Google Doc with the elements that I would need to put in tags once workign in Oxygen in order to introduce us to all the things we would have to do for our assignment and to ease us into the coding process. 

## Markup in Google Docs 

After being assigned our individual sections, we each had accesss to a Google Doc with our text copied into it. There, we marked things like where paragraphs started, any quotations, italics, em-dashes, and even images. I was really thankful to only have paragraph markers, dialogue, and one instance where a word was italicised in my reading, so I wasn't overly confused about what I needed to be marking in this section of the project.
