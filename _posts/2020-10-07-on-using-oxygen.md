# On Using Oxygen: My First Experience with Coding in XML 

---

For this assignment, I was given the second column of page 649 of Charlotte Perkins Stetson's short horror story, "The Yellow Wallpaper". With this section, I was tasked with coding the text as it appeared using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) in Oxygen, a coding program that uses eXtensible Markup Language (XML). As a part of our assignment, I mimicked markup in a Google Doc with the elements that I would need to put in tags once workign in Oxygen in order to introduce us to all the things we would have to do for our assignment and to ease us into the coding process.
