# On Using Oxygen: My First Experience with Coding in XML 

---

For this assignment, I was given the second column of page 649 of Charlotte Perkins Stetson's short horror story, "The Yellow Wallpaper". With this section, I was tasked with coding the text as it appeared using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) in Oxygen, a coding program that uses eXtensible Markup Language (XML). As a part of our assignment, I mimicked markup in a Google Doc with the elements that I would need to put in tags once workign in Oxygen in order to introduce us to all the things we would have to do for our assignment and to ease us into the coding process. 

## Markup in Google Docs 

After being assigned our individual sections, we each had accesss to a Google Doc with our text copied into it. There, we marked things like where paragraphs started, any quotations, italics, em-dashes, and even images. I was really thankful to only have paragraph markers, dialogue, and one instance where a word was italicised in my reading, so I wasn't overly confused about what I needed to be marking in this section of the project.

Further, by going through and marking each thing that I would be coding later, it really helped to break down what I needed to do once I started working in Oxygen. Looking at my Doc, I felt a lot less overwhelmed, and the coding aspect seemed a lot less daunting. 

## Using Oxygen and XML

While marking the Google Doc helped to ease a lot of fears about this project, once I had to download Oxygen, that fear returned. I'm not super tech-savvy. My parents are both computer analysts, but it seems like that tech gene skipped a generation. Opening Oxygen and the TEI file I would be working in for the first time was super overwhelmingâ€”the file opened up, and suddenly I was faced with all of these lines of code and I had no idea what they meant. 

Further, when I work in Word, Docs, and other word processors, I find a lot of comfort in knowing what each of the functions are and where to find everything. Even though my professor was teaching us how to us Oxygen, it was still a huge learning curve as I clicked around, trying to get the hang of the program. Thankfully, by the end of the class period, I started to feel more comfortable with using the program, but it also helped that our professor gave us time during the following class period to work in coding so that we could ask her questions.
