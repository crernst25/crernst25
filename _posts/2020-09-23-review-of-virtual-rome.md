## About the Project

Virtual Rome is an online model of some of Ancient Rome's most important and iconic monuments created by Dr. Matthew Nicholls, an Associate Professor of Classics at the University of Reading in England. He has interests in both Roman society and histiry, and online models in educational settings, which led him to begin this project in the first place. 

Virtual Rome's main attraction is their model of the Colosseum. By loading their program, you can interact with the monument how it looked hundreds of years ago when it was first built--intact with pure white stone. Users can zoom in on different aspects of the Colosseum, getting to see the minute detailing of the monument up close. You can also rotate the monument around so that you can view it from different perspectives. 

Another important feature of the model is the ability to change the lighting to imitate different times of the day. In an article that Nicholls wrote about his study on a different Roman monument, he talks about how lighting in a specific structure can lead historians to what the possible functions of the monument were. By exploring the lighting in the Colosseum, Nicholls is inviting scholars and students to discuss the significance of the lighting in terms of archaeological structure of the monument. 

## Review of the Project

As a Classical Studies minor and someone who studied abroad in Rome last fall, this project really appealed to me. The Colosseum was one of my favorite places to visit while living there, and the idea of being able to see what it looked like when it was originally constructed made this project really interesting.
