## About the Project

Virtual Rome is an online model of some of Ancient Rome's most important and iconic monuments created by Dr. Matthew Nicholls, an Associate Professor of Classics at the University of Reading in England. He has interests in both Roman society and histiry, and online models in educational settings, which led him to begin this project in the first place.
