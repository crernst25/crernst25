## About the Project

Virtual Rome is an online model of some of Ancient Rome's most important and iconic monuments created by Dr. Matthew Nicholls, an Associate Professor of Classics at the University of Reading in England. He has interests in both Roman society and histiry, and online models in educational settings, which led him to begin this project in the first place. 

Virtual Rome's main attraction is their model of the Colosseum. By loading their program, you can interact with the monument how it looked hundreds of years ago when it was first built--intact with pure white stone. Users can zoom in on different aspects of the Colosseum, getting to see the minute detailing of the monument up close. You can also rotate the monument around so that you can view it from different perspectives.
