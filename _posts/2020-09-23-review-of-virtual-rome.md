## About the Project

Virtual Rome is an online model of some of Ancient Rome's most important and iconic monuments created by Dr. Matthew Nicholls, an Associate Professor of Classics at the University of Reading in England. He has interests in both Roman society and history, and online models in educational settings, which led him to begin this project in the first place. 

Virtual Rome's main attraction is their model of the Colosseum. By loading their program, you can interact with the monument how it looked hundreds of years ago when it was first built—intact with pure white stone. Users can zoom in on different aspects of the Colosseum, getting to see the minute detailing of the monument up close. You can also rotate the monument around so that you can view it from different perspectives. 

Another important feature of the model is the ability to change the lighting to imitate different times of the day. In an article that Nicholls wrote about his study on a different Roman monument, he talks about how lighting in a specific structure can lead historians to what the possible functions of the monument were. By exploring the lighting in the Colosseum, Nicholls is inviting scholars and students to discuss the significance of the lighting in terms of archaeological structure of the monument. 

## Review of the Project

As a Classical Studies minor and someone who studied abroad in Rome last fall, this project really appealed to me. The Colosseum was one of my favorite places to visit while living there, and the idea of being able to see what it looked like when it was originally constructed made this project really interesting. 

Using the interface, it isn't super clear what the purpose of the project is. I took the time to dig around the site and found out Nicholl's interests in light, but if I hadn't, the light tool's purpose might not be completely obvious. The bar to change the light is very clear on the right side of the model, so it obvious that this is something that you are supposed to use, but after trying it out, it is a little confusing to see that it only adjusts the lighting on the monument. 

Continuing, it would have been really helpful if there was a short tutorial option that showed new users how to use the model and introduce them to the tools. Even though this model is targeted at people studying Ancient Rome and the Colosseum in particular, it might be more available to other audiences if the general public can be instructed on how to use it. Further, people within the Classics field might not have a lot of experience with online models, and could benefit from that as well, since not every Ancient Rome enthusiast shares Nicholls' interest in virtual models. 

Once I got oriented with the project and its purpose, I started to move around to get a closer look of the monument that I loved so much. I found it a little hard to navigate on the model, however; the zoom and movement functions seemed to be a little sensitive, and it was hard to make small movements across the model. I really wanted to get a close up look at the arches, and even though the arches are a big part of the Colosseum, every time I tried to zoom in, my screen would instead zoom in on the plain grey background and I would have to zoom back out to even find where the Colosseum was on the model. 

Still, with a lot of time and patience, I got to navigate the Colosseum. I loved being able to see what it looked like as a full structure, rather than the ruins that we have left and how the statues added to the façade. The virtual model did include a video tour that took viewers briefly through the Colosseum, which can be helpful for those who get frustrated easily with the interface. The site also offers different options for viewing, like a mobile version and ways to view it on apps like AR and Cardboard, which can be helpful in reaching wider audiences. 

Despite my critiques of the model, the detail of this project is just incredible and I still had the same level of saw viewing this online Colosseum that I did seeing it in person.
