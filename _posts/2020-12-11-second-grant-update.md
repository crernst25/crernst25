# Another Update on the Grant Project

---

## What I Have Been Working On 

In my last blog post, I talked a lot about the amazing resources and projects that I have found to help support the various aspects of my grant. Now that I have compiled and collected my research, my time has shifted away from the research process and more towards compiling that research and writing my grant. 

## The Writing Process

This project is definitely interesting in terms of my writing process. When it comes down to something like this, I usually struggle to find research, but once I have that finished, I have no problem writing. This assignment seemed to flip that notion where the research was fairly straightfoward, but then I found the writing portion to be a little frustrating later.
