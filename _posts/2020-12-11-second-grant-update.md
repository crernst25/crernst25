# Another Update on the Grant Project

---

In my last blog post, I talked a lot about the amazing resources and projects that I have found to help support the various aspects of my grant. Now that I have compiled and collected my research, my time has shifted away from the research process and more towards compiling that research and writing my grant. 

## The Writing Process

This project is definitely interesting in terms of my writing process. When it comes down to something like this, I usually struggle to find research, but once I have that finished, I have no problem writing. This assignment seemed to flip that notion where the research was fairly straightfoward, but then I found the writing portion to be a little frustrating later. 

I think a lot of this comes down to the fact that, in the end, I overwrite. Normally, this is not a problem. As an English major, the majority of my papers are usually around 8-12 pages. Grant writing, however, seems to actively go against my overwriting tendencies, since everything needs to be concise with no extra fluff. Every time I sat down to write a portion of my grant, I was challenged to determine which information was necessary and what was fluff. Every thirty minutes, I was having a stare down with the page count at the bottom of my screen, trying to decide what more I could say in the half page I had left, and weight that with what I still *wanted* to say. 

In the end, I think what I have is stronger because I was forced to choose between those long, lofty sentences I tend to fill my essays with and the necessary information I need to explain my project. 

## Peer Reviews and the Purpose of My Assignment

While the peer reviews have been really helpful in making sure I have all of various aspects that go into each part of my grant and for checking things like clarity, organization, and grammar, the peer reviews on the grant narrative have also really affirmed why I am pitching this project. 

We did two peer reviews in class on the grant narrative, which is where not only explain what my project is, but *who* Sappho is and why she is important. I don't spend a lot of time on this, but I give a brief introduction on her so readers who aren't as familiar with her or the Classical Studies field can go in what a basic knowledge of Sappho and her work. 

When reviewing the comments from both of my reviewers, both of them mentioned that they didn't know who Sappho was prior to reading my grant narrative. 

Peer Review 1:

Yes, it definitely grabbed me and threw me into the paper. I'd say this is a good thing because I didn't even know about this person until reading this. The conclusion wraps everything up well but could reiterate why she is important to study. Would help reinforce a few ideas." The line "I'd say this is a good thing because I didn't even know about this person until reading this" is highlighted in blue](http://crernst25.github.io/crernst25/images/peer-review-1.png) 

Peer Review 2:
![Screenshot that says: "Your grant narrative looks good. I actually didn't know about Sappho until I read this. I think that you topic is amazing for your skillset"](http://crernst25.github.io/crernst25/images/peer-review-2.png) 

Especially since I didn't have a lot of in-depth details about Sappho's life or her poetry, I think that this helps to affirm one of the purposes of this project, which is to teach people about a poet who is often left out of school curriculum in favor of men. Though my site will focus on her poetry and the various translation, its existence also functions to teach others about an important and overlooked Ancient Greek poet, and possibly introduce users to a new area of study that they might not have found otherwise. 

Overall, I am really glad that I ended up taking this class. I learned a lot of different skills in this class that I'm sure I can apply one day to the workplace. Even if I don't, I feel like I gained from what this class taught me and I definitely improved as a writer because of it.
