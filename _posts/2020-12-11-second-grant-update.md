# Another Update on the Grant Project

---

## What I Have Been Working On 

In my last blog post, I talked a lot about the amazing resources and projects that I have found to help support the various aspects of my grant. Now that I have compiled and collected my research, my time has shifted away from the research process and more towards compiling that research and writing my grant. 

## The Writing Process

This project is definitely interesting in terms of my writing process. When it comes down to something like this, I usually struggle to find research, but once I have that finished, I have no problem writing. This assignment seemed to flip that notion where the research was fairly straightfoward, but then I found the writing portion to be a little frustrating later. 

I think a lot of this comes down to the fact that, in the end, I overwrite. Normally, this is not a problem. As an English major, the majority of my papers are usually around 8-12 pages. Grant writing, however, seems to actively go against my overwriting tendencies, since everything needs to be concise with no extra fluff. Every time I sat down to write a portion of my grant, I was challenged to determine which information was necessary and what was fluff while revising. Every thirty minutes, I was having a stare down with the page count at the bottom of my screen, trying to decide what more I could say in the half page I had left, and weight that with what I still *wanted* to say. 

In the end, I think what I have is stronger because I was forced to choose between those long, lofty sentences I tend to fill my essays with and the necessary information I need to explain my project.
